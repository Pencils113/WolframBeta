# wolframbeta

An homage to Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Beta is my authentic, homemade (and often convoluted) attempt at realizing math in Java using Apache Groovy (code from ~2020, uploading in 2022)

Wolfram Beta can perform arithmetic evaluate functions, solve single variable equations, find the zeroes, asymptotes and extrema of functions, 
evaluate series, find limits, evaluate tangent line slopes, approximate definite integrals, and even find the derivatives and indefinite
integrals of common functions.

## Should I use Wolfram Alpha or Wolfram Beta?

Wolfram Beta
+ Fast
+ User satisfaction guaranteed
+ No internet required

Wolfram Alpha
+ Natural language processing
+ Accessible
+ More features

## The Future

I plan to code new features related to Linear Algebra (determinants, systems of equations, eigenvalues, etc.), and improve algebraic simplification.
